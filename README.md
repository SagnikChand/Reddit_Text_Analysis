# Analyzing Student Sentiments and Challenges in Learning Data Science: A Reddit-Based Study

This repository contains an R project that investigates the sentiments and challenges faced by students learning data science, leveraging text data scraped from various Reddit communities. The study aims to uncover recurring themes, emotions, and shared experiences of students navigating this rapidly evolving field.



## **Project Description**
Data science is a promising but challenging field of study. By analyzing discussions from subreddits like `r/datascience`, `r/datasciencestudents`, `r/learndatascience`, and `r/learnmachinelearning`, this project examines students' perspectives on their learning journeys. Using advanced text analysis techniques, this study provides insights into the common challenges, frustrations, and motivations students express, aiming to improve educational approaches in data science.



### **Research Question**
- **What are studentsâ€™ common themes and sentiments regarding their experiences and challenges in learning data science?**



### **Hypothesis**
1. Students show a mix of:
   - Enthusiasm for career opportunities and subject matter.
   - Frustration due to the steep learning curve and complexity of concepts.
2. Themes like resource accessibility, curriculum difficulties, and peer support are prevalent.



### **Key Features**
- **Scraping Data**: Extracting discussions from Reddit using APIs.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
- **Visualization**: Creating word clouds and summary tables to highlight frequent terms and trends.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Categorizing text into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- **Topic Modeling**: Identifying latent themes using methods like LDA and STM.



### **Technologies Used**
- **R Packages**: `quanteda`, `tidyverse`, `wordcloud`, `topicmodels`, and more.
- **Data Sources**: Reddit subreddits related to data science and machine learning.
- **Text Analysis Techniques**: Sentiment analysis, word frequency analysis, and topic modeling.



### **Outcomes**
- Insights into students' learning experiences, including their challenges and motivations.
- Identification of themes to inform educators and course developers.
- Suggestions for making data science education more effective and accessible.



## **How to Use**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install required R packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("quanteda", "tidyverse", "wordcloud", "topicmodels"))
   ```
3. Follow the scripts for:
   - Data scraping and preprocessing.
   - Sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
   - Visualization and result interpretation.


This project aspires to bridge the gap between student experiences and effective teaching practices in data science. Contributions and feedback are welcome to enhance the analysis and findings.
